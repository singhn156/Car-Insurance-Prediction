# Car-Insurance-Prediction
## Description
This is a dataset from one bank in the United States. Besides usual services, this bank also provides car
insurance services. The bank organizes regular campaigns to attract new clients. The bank has potential
customers’ data, and bank’s employees call them for advertising available car insurance options. We are
provided with general information about clients (age, job, etc.) as well as more specific information about the
current insurance sell campaign (communication, last contact day) and previous campaigns (attributes like
previous attempts, outcome).
You have data about 4000 customers who were contacted during the last campaign and for whom the results
of campaign (did the customer buy insurance or not) are known.
